# 🧠 AI/ML Projects – Summer Task 2025

This repository contains **three AI-powered Python projects** developed using **Flask**, **Gemini API**, and **Machine Learning models**. Each project demonstrates a different domain: conversational AI, health risk prediction, and data visualization.

📍 Developed as part of the **Summer Project Submission**

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. 🤖 [Health Query Chatbot](./health-query-chatbot)

A human-like health assistant that responds to user symptoms, tracks context, and offers general prevention tips (only if the user agrees). It uses **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API** to generate smart, conversational responses.

**Highlights:**
- Tracks symptoms & timeline from user messages
- Offers tips after collecting 3+ symptoms
- Uses session memory & chat logging
- Ethical design: no treatment or diagnosis

---

### 2. ❤️ [Heart Disease Risk Prediction](./Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction)

A Flask web app that predicts the **risk level of heart disease** (0–4) based on user input using a machine learning model trained on medical data.

**Highlights:**
- Trained using UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- Logistic Regression model with confidence
- User-friendly medical-style form
- Shows “At Risk” result for predictions > 0

---

### 3. 🌸 [Iris Data Visualization](./iris-data-visualization)

An exploratory data visualization project built using **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib** to showcase relationships in the classic Iris flower dataset.

**Highlights:**
- Clean and interactive visualizations
- Histograms, boxplots, pair plots, and scatterplots
- Step-by-step EDA pipeline
- Ideal beginner-level ML dataset exploration
